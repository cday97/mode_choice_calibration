# Question {#intro}

**Are outputs more realistic when a microsimulation tool uses a mode choice structure that mimics the activity-based model that was used to create its inputs?**

Mode choice is one of the four basic steps in the transportation planning process. Modeling the specific mode choices of individuals with only a subset of population data has always proven difficult for analysts. Since mode is usually defined as a discrete variable, numerous discrete choice models have been used in predicting the mode choice decision. 

Activity-based and microsimulation models are useful tools in travel demand modeling. The mode choice structures within these frameworks play a significant role in the transportation planning process. Oftentimes, the outputs of activity-based models are used as the inputs to microsimulation models. The determinations of the microsimulation models are then used to help engineers and planners forecast the transportation needs within the community. Therefore, one must question if having vastly different mode choice structures within activity-based models and microsimulation tools affects the final outputs; and thus, if it shapes the transportation needs of the community in an incorrect way.
