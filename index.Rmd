# Question {#intro}

**Are outputs more realistic when a microsimulation tool uses a mode choice structure that mimics the activity-based model that was used to create its inputs?**

## Background
Activity-based and microsimulation models are useful tools in travel demand modeling. The mode choice structures within these frameworks play a significant role in transportation planning processes. Oftentimes, the outputs of activity-based models are used as the inputs to microsimulation models. The determinations of the microsimulation models are used to help planners forecast the transportation needs within the community. Therefore, one must question if having vastly different mode choice structures within activity-based models and microsimulation tools affects the final outputs; and thus, if it shapes the transportation needs of the community in an incorrect way. 

A significant part of activity-based modeling is the mode choice decision within the model. Originally, Bhat & Koppelman (1999) stated that travel demand models used individual trips as the primary unit of analysis. However, there has been a shift toward activity-based travel demand modeling, and in recent years, there has been variation in how that is done. For example, Eluru et al. (2010) developed a joint multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) framework to model the individual’s choices across activity type, time of day, mode, destination, and time use. In addition, Hasnine et al. (2021) conducted research on a variety of activity-based models from the years 1995 to 2020 and found that seven specific mode choice analyses have been used. From simply using tour-based modeling, to nested models, to more iterative and dynamic processes, or simply calculating mode choice elsewhere, many techniques have been established Hasnine et al. (2021). Like with activity-based models, mode choice models within microsimulation may undergo some variation in the coming years.

MATSim is an example of a microsimulation tool used today. Horni et al. (2021) explains that mode choice in MATSim is chosen through an iterative cycle where every agent optimizes its daily activity pattern by picking the best option each cycle. Ciari et al. (2008) proposed introducing discrete choice, in the form of multinomial logit models, on the subtour level of mode choice. Another microsimulation tool, similar to MATSim, is BEAM. According to El Zarwi et al. (2017), BEAM’s framework is designed to model and forecast new transportation services. Originally, it used an LCCM as the mode choice structure. Now, however, it instead uses something similar to a nested multinomial logit model. Barth et al. (2020) proposed that BEAM implements a fundamental influencing factor (FIF) mode choice model instead of the original LCCM or the current MNL. 

Microsimulation mode choice structure may advance in the coming years, but they will still be mis-aligned with the activity-based mode choice structure. In addition, activity-based models are not uniform in their mode choice structures. The outputs to many activity-based models serve as the inputs to microsimulation models. Therefore, aligning the internal structure of mode choice in microsimulation with the mode choice in activity-based models may be a useful advancement in mode choice modeling.
