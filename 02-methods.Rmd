# Methods

In our research, the input population used to model behavior corresponds to individuals in the Salt Lake City, Utah, US Region. The activity-based model used to generate the microsimulation input data is ActivitySim [@activitysim]. The microsimulation tool used to generate travel behavior data is BEAM [@beam].

ActivitySim implements a multifaceted mode choice model that is dependent on trip, tour, and purpose. One model determines the primary mode for each tour and a separate model determines the mode for each trip. In addition, each modal decision is dependent on the current tour purpose value. Contrastingly, BEAM's default mode choice structure uses a simple multinomial logit model, independent of tour purpose value. Therefore, in order to test our hypothesis, we aligned the mode choice structure of BEAM (a microsimulation tool) with that of ActivitySim (an activity-based model).

To closely align the mode choice structure of BEAM with ActivitySim, we changed much about the code structure inside of BEAM. More specifically, we wrote code that forced modal decisions to be based on tour purpose values. We also implemented the use of ActivitySim's path, person, and location utility parameter values to calculate modal alternative probabilities. These simple steps allowed us to create consistency between an activity-based model and a microsimulation tool.

To test the effectiveness of our calibrated mode choice model, we conducted five different test scenarios within BEAM and compared their outputs with eachout. Each test scenario that we simulated used a multinomial logit function to determine modal probabilities. Although all used a multinomial logit function, each scenario used a different utility function to predict behavior. 

The first sceneario we ran used the default BEAM structure. This represented a model with an inconsistent mode choice structure \@ref(eq:label1). The next three scenarios we ran used a purpose based model with part of ActivitySim's utility function (either using the path \@ref(eq:label2), person \@ref(eq:label3), or location type \@ref(eq:label4) variables). These represented models with semi-consistent mode choice structures. The last scenario we ran used a pupose based model with ActivitySim's complete utility function. This represented a model with a consistent mode choice structure \@ref(eq:label5). Simplified versions of the utility function used in each of the scenarios can be seen in the following equations. \


*Eq 1: BEAM's Default Utility Equation*

\begin{equation}
  V_j = ASC_j + \beta_{c}(c) + \beta_{t}(t) + \beta_{xfer}(xfer) (\#eq:label1)
\end{equation}

where
  
  - $j$ is the modal alternative, 
  - $c$ is the cost, 
  - $t$ is the travel time, and
  - $xfer$ is the number of transfers.

*Eq 2: Utility Equation using ActivitySim's Path Variables*

\begin{equation}
  V_j = \beta_{t_v}(t_v) + \beta_{t_w}(t_w) + \beta_{t_e}(t_e) + \beta_{tr_p}(tr_p) + \beta_{xfer}(xfer) + \beta_{w_{dis}}(w_{dis}) + \\ \beta_{b_{dis}}(b_{dis}) + \beta_{d_{dis}}(d_{dis}) (\#eq:label2)
\end{equation}  

where 

  - $j$ is the modal alternative,
  - $t_v$ is the in vehicle travel time (mins),
  - $t_w$ is the wait time (mins),
  - $t_e$ is the egress time (mins),
  - $tr_p$ is the proximity to transit (miles),
  - $xfer$ is the number of transfers,
  - $w_{dis}$ is the walk distance (miles),
  - $b_{dis}$ is the bike distance (miles),
  - $d_{dis}$ is the drive distance (miles),
  - $\beta_{tr_p}$ differs between origin/destination and length, and
  - $\beta_{w_{dis}}$, $\beta_{b_{dis}}$, and $\beta_{d_{dis}}$ differ between lengths.
  - *Note:* All $\beta$ values differ between mode and tour purpose.

*Eq 3: Utility Equation using ActivitySim's Person Variables*

\begin{equation}
  V_j = ASC_{auto} +  \beta_{c}(c) + \beta_{ag}(ag) (\#eq:label3)
\end{equation}

where
  
  - $j$ is the modal alternative, 
  - $ASC_{auto}$ is the alternative specific constant that differs between modal alternative and auto ownership dependency,
  - $c$ is the cost, and
  - $ag$ is the age grouping (if the person is between 0-10 or 16-19 years old).
  - *Note:* All $\beta$ values differ between mode and tour purpose.

*Eq 4: Utility Equation using ActivitySim's Location Variables*

\begin{equation}
  V_j = \beta_{zdi}(zdi) + \beta_{cbd}(cbd) (\#eq:label4)
\end{equation}

where 
  
  - $j$ is the modal alternative
  - $zdi$ is the zonal density index,
  - $cbd$ is a classifier for zones labeled as central business district, and
  - $\beta_{zdi}$ differs between origin/destination.
  - *Note:* All $\beta$ values differ between mode and tour purpose.
  
*Eq 5: Utility Equation using All of ActivitySim's Variables*
  
\begin{equation}  
  V_j = Eq:2 + Eq:3 + Eq:4 (\#eq:label5)
\end{equation}

where
  
  - $j$ is the modal alternative.
