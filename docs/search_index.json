If so, which population characteristics within the mode choice model has the most significant effect in estimating realistic results? In recent years, there has been variation in how the mode choice is estimated within activity-based travel demand modeling. Originally, Bhat and Koppelman (1999) stated that travel demand models should use individual trips as the primary unit of analysis, and to calculate mode at a trip level. More recently, Eluru et al. (2010) developed a joint multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) framework to model the individuals mode choice (among other decisions). Hasnine and Nurul Habib (2021) listed differing estimation techniques found in activity-based models, some of which include tour-based modeling, nested model structures, iterative and dynamic processes, and simply calculating the mode choice elsewhere and feeding it in as an input. Overall, various methods have been in practice. Like with activity-based models, mode choice estimation in microsimulation tools is not universal. W Axhausen, Horni, and Nagel (2016) explains that mode choice in MATSim is chosen using the Charypar-Nagel Utility Function, where agents pick the best alternative based on their uniquely calculated utility score. Alternatively, Ciari, Balmer, and Axhausen (2008) proposed introducing multinomial logit models on the subtour level to increase mode choice estimation accuracy. In addition, BEAM originally used a Latent Class Choice Model as its mode choice structure, but then switched to a simple multinomial logit model. Alternatively, Barth et al. (2020) proposed that BEAM implements a fundamental influencing factor (FIF) mode choice model instead. Overall, it does not seem ideal to develop a single, universal technique to estimating mode choice because modeling perfect human behavior is impossible. However, a useful advancement in improved mode choice modeling could be to simply align the internal structure of mode choice in microsimulation with mode choice in activity-based models. Oftentimes, the outputs of activity-based models are used as the inputs to microsimulation tools. Yet, the way mode choice is estimated in a microsimulation tool rarely matches that of its parent activity-based model. This heterogeneity of estimation between models may lead to increased variability in the final microsimulation results. We hypothesize that a microsimulation tool with a mode choice structure that mimics that of its parenting activity-based model more accurately simulates the distribution of mode choice across a population. In addition, we explore which population characteristics within the mode choice model has the most significant effect in estimating realistic results.

The activity-based model used to generate the microsimulation input data is ActivitySim (ActivitySim 2021). The microsimulation tool used to generate travel behavior data is BEAM (BEAMs User Guide 2021). ActivitySim implements a multifaceted mode choice model that is dependent on trip, tour, and purpose. One model determines the primary mode for each tour and a separate model determines the mode for each trip. In addition, each modal decision is dependent on the current tour purpose value. Contrastingly, BEAMs default mode choice structure uses a simple multinomial logit model as its predictor. In our study, ActivitySims tour-based mode choice model was coded into the BEAM framework. Mode choice decisions were based on tour purposes. In addition, ActivitySims path, person, and location utility parameter values were added to BEAMs Multinomial Logit function. BEAM was then run using five different mode choice models. These five models are described below. BEAMs default multinomial logit function with default parameters ActivitySims purpose dependent multinomial logit function using only path-type parameters ActivitySims purpose dependent multinomial logit function using only person-type parameters ActivitySims purpose dependent multinomial logit function using only location-type parameters ActivitySims purpose dependent multinomial logit function using all available parameters 2.1 Data The data analyzed in our study includes the events files generated by BEAM for each BEAM structure. The events file stores all the decisions made by all individuals during the simulation, including their mode choice decisions. The events files generated from each version of BEAM (the 5 versions explained above) were compared with each other. The variables of interest that were analyzed from the events files include the following: Person ID Trip ID Tour Index Tour Purpose Mode Chosen Vehicle Ownership Income 2.2 Models A different multinomial logit function exists for each version of BEAM that was run. Instead of writing out the lengthy equation that exists for each version, a table of utility parameters and their values are provided for each model. The following tables (Table 1 through Table 4) provide this information. ## # A tibble: 36 x 7 ## model tourType variable alternative units latentClass value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 modeChoice MNL cost bike util/min NA -1 ## 2 modeChoice MNL cost bike_transit util/min NA -1 ## 3 modeChoice MNL cost car util/min NA -1 ## 4 modeChoice MNL cost drive_transit util/min NA -1 ## 5 modeChoice MNL cost ride_hail util/min NA -1 ## 6 modeChoice MNL cost ride_hail_pooled util/min NA -1 ## 7 modeChoice MNL cost ride_hail_transit util/min NA -1 ## 8 modeChoice MNL cost walk util/min NA -1 ## 9 modeChoice MNL cost walk_transit util/min NA -1 ## 10 modeChoice MNL time bike util/min NA -0.0047 ## # ... with 26 more rows (I havent decided yet if I want to put in tables of values here of multinomial logit functions or neither. The tables are really long, but easier to understand whereas the functions are shorter but have a million variables and are harder to understand.)
