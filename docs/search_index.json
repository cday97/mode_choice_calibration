If so, which population characteristics within the mode choice model has the most significant effect in estimating realistic results? In recent years, there has been variation in how the mode choice is estimated within activity-based travel demand modeling. Originally, Bhat and Koppelman (1999) stated that travel demand models should use individual trips as the primary unit of analysis, and to calculate mode at a trip level. More recently, Eluru et al. (2010) developed a joint multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) framework to model the individuals mode choice (among other decisions). Hasnine and Nurul Habib (2021) listed differing estimation techniques found in activity-based models, some of which include tour-based modeling, nested model structures, iterative and dynamic processes, and simply calculating the mode choice elsewhere and feeding it in as an input. Overall, various methods have been in practice. Like with activity-based models, mode choice estimation in microsimulation tools is not universal. W Axhausen, Horni, and Nagel (2016) explains that mode choice in MATSim is chosen using the Charypar-Nagel Utility Function, where agents pick the best alternative based on their uniquely calculated utility score. Alternatively, Ciari, Balmer, and Axhausen (2008) proposed introducing multinomial logit models on the subtour level to increase mode choice estimation accuracy. In addition, BEAM originally used a Latent Class Choice Model as its mode choice structure, but then switched to a simple multinomial logit model. Alternatively, Barth et al. (2020) proposed that BEAM implements a fundamental influencing factor (FIF) mode choice model instead. Overall, it does not seem ideal to develop a single, universal technique to estimating mode choice because modeling perfect human behavior is impossible. However, a useful advancement in improved mode choice modeling could be to simply align the internal structure of mode choice in microsimulation with mode choice in activity-based models. Oftentimes, the outputs of activity-based models are used as the inputs to microsimulation tools. Yet, the way mode choice is estimated in a microsimulation tool rarely matches that of its parent activity-based model. This heterogeneity of estimation between models may lead to increased variability in the final microsimulation results. We hypothesize that a microsimulation tool with a mode choice structure that mimics that of its parenting activity-based model more accurately simulates the distribution of mode choice across a population. In addition, we explore which population characteristics within the mode choice model has the most significant effect in estimating realistic results.

The activity-based model used to generate the microsimulation input data is ActivitySim (ActivitySim 2021). The microsimulation tool used to generate travel behavior data is BEAM (BEAMs User Guide 2021). ActivitySim implements a multifaceted mode choice model that is dependent on trip, tour, and purpose. One model determines the primary mode for each tour and a separate model determines the mode for each trip. In addition, each modal decision is dependent on the current tour purpose value. Contrastingly, BEAMs default mode choice structure uses a simple multinomial logit model as its predictor. In our study, ActivitySims tour-based mode choice model was coded into the BEAM framework. Mode choice decisions were based on tour purposes. In addition, ActivitySims path, person, and location utility parameter values were used to calculate each modal alternative. BEAM was run using five different mode choice models. All models implemented the multinomial logit choice model structure. However, the utility equation used to calculate each modal alternative differed between models. In addition, the tour purpose framework was added to all but the default BEAM version. The five differing models that were run are shown below. MNL using BEAMs default utility function with default parameters MNL using ActivitySims purpose dependent utility function using only path-type parameters MNL using ActivitySims purpose dependent utility function using only person-type parameters MNL using ActivitySims purpose dependent utility function using only location-type parameters MNL using ActivitySims purpose dependent utility function using all available parameters 2.1 Data The data analyzed in our study includes the events files generated by BEAM for each BEAM structure. The events file stores all the decisions made by all individuals during the simulation, including their mode choice decisions. The events files generated from each version of BEAM (the 5 versions explained above) were compared with each other. The variables of interest that were analyzed from the events files include the following: Person ID Trip ID Tour Index Tour Purpose Mode Chosen Vehicle Ownership Income 2.2 Models A different utility function exists for each version of BEAM that was run. The following equations show a simplified version of the different utility equations that were inputted into the multinomial logit choice model in BEAM. There are five total equations; four of them are sections of ActivitySims utility equation and one of them is the default BEAM equation. 2.2.1 BEAMs Default Utility Equation \\[\\begin{equation} V_j = ASC_j + \\beta_{c}(c) + \\beta_{t}(t) + \\beta_{xfer}(xfer) \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(j\\) is the modal alternative, \\(c\\) is the cost, \\(t\\) is the travel time, \\(xfer\\) is the number of transfers 2.2.2 Utility Equation using ActivitySims Path Variables \\[\\begin{equation} V_j = \\beta_{t_v}(t_v) + \\beta_{t_w}(t_w) + \\beta_{t_e}(t_e) + \\beta_{tr_p}(tr_p) + \\beta_{xfer}(xfer) + \\beta_{w_{dis}}(w_{dis}) + \\\\ \\beta_{b_{dis}}(b_{dis}) + \\beta_{d_{dis}}(d_{dis}) \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(j\\) is the modal alternative, \\(t_v\\) is the in vehicle travel time (mins), \\(t_w\\) is the wait time (mins), \\(t_e\\) is the egress time (mins), \\(tr_p\\) is the proximity to transit (miles), \\(xfer\\) is the number of transfers, \\(w_{dis}\\) is the walk distance (miles), \\(b_{dis}\\) is the bike distance (miles), \\(d_{dis}\\) is the drive distance (miles), \\(\\beta_{tr_p}\\) differs between origin/destination and length, \\(\\beta_{w_{dis}}\\), \\(\\beta_{b_{dis}}\\), and \\(\\beta_{d_{dis}}\\) differ between lengths Note: All \\(\\beta\\) values differ between mode and tour purpose 2.2.3 Utility Equation using ActivitySims Person Variables \\[\\begin{equation} V_j = ASC_{auto} + \\beta_{c}(c) + \\beta_{ag}(ag) \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(j\\) is the modal alternative, \\(ASC_{auto}\\) is the alternative specific constant that differs between modal alternative and auto ownership dependency, \\(c\\) is the cost, \\(ag\\) is the age grouping (if the person is between 0-10 or 16-19 years old), Note: All \\(\\beta\\) values differ between mode and tour purpose 2.2.4 Utility Equation using ActivitySims Location Variables \\[\\begin{equation} V_j = \\beta_{zdi}(zdi) + \\beta_{cbd}(cbd) \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(j\\) is the modal alternative \\(zdi\\) is the zonal density index, \\(cbd\\) is a classifier for zones labeled as central business district, \\(\\beta_{zdi}\\) differs between origin/destination Note: All \\(\\beta\\) values differ between mode and tour purpose 2.2.5 Utility Equation using All of ActivitySims Variables \\[\\begin{equation} V_j = Eq:2.2 + Eq:2.3 + Eq:2.4 \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(j\\) is the modal alternative Please note that the results have not been calibrated so a lot of this finding is bologna References "],["findings.html", " 3 Findings 3.1 Total Modal Share 3.2 Modal Share by Vehicle Ownership 3.3 Modal Share by Tour Purpose 3.4 Additional Analysis", " 3 Findings After running each of the models, each models modal shares were calculated using the output events files. To thouroughly understand the affect that each model had on modal shares, different variables were used to determine them. Specifcally, the following three modal share outputs were created: Total Modal Share Modal Share based on Vehicle Ownership Modal Share based on Tour Purpose (All three modal share findings were created using the ggplot2 library along with the tidyverse library.) The modal share in general describes the percentage of individuals in the simulattion that chose each modal alternatives. A total of 9 modal alternatives were given to the agents: Car Drive Transit Ride Hail Ride Hail Pooled Ride Hail Tranist Shared 2 Ride Shared 3+ Ride Walk Walk Transit Comparing the modal share of each of the models with the actual modal share of the region allows one to determine the optimal mode choice structure. In the following comparison, the variable WFRC represents the actual modal share of the region. 3.1 Total Modal Share The total modal share simply describes the total division of mode choice alternatives for the entire population. The following figure shows the total modal share. By examining the graph above, it can clearly be seen that the MNL model provides the car modal share closest to that of the actual region . Although this is true, the ALL model provides a closer walk modal share than the rest. The other modal alternatives all seem relatively similar. 3.2 Modal Share by Vehicle Ownership The modal share by vehicle ownership provides a more detailed view of how the modes are distributed across the population based on their vehicle ownership status. The following figure shows the modal share by vehicle ownership. By examining the graph above, the MNL model seems to be much less accurate than the other models for agents that are auto deficient and auto sufficient. The Path model as well as the All model seem to be closest to the WFRC results in these vehicle ownership categories. As a result, the Path variable has the largest affect on the vehicle ownership modal estimation. For the no auto category though, the MNL and Path models seem to predict relatively well.The All model however, does not seem to be a very good predictor of modal shares for this category. 3.3 Modal Share by Tour Purpose The modal share by tour purpose provides a more detailed view of how the modes are distributed across the population based on the tour purpose of the agents trip. The following figure shows the modal share by tour purpose. Unfortunately, the figure above does not include real world data from WFRC. By examing the figure though, it is clear to see that there is a difference in mode choice depending on the tour purpose chosen by the agent. For example, in all the models, car is the highest chosen mode for work trips, whereas for school trips, walking is slightly higher than carpooling and car trips. 3.4 Additional Analysis Overall, it can be seen that a microsimulation tool with a mode choice structure that mimics that of its parenting activity-based model more accurately simulates the distribution of mode choice across a population. This can be verified by examining the comparison modal share graphs; the All model seemed to most accurately variables. In addition, we see that the variables relating to Person types have the most significant effect in estimating realistic results. The Locaiton and Path types of the activity-based model seemed to relatively little in comparison to the Person types. This can be verified by examining the comparison modal share graphs as well; the Person variable seemed to be the most different when compared to the other factors. We suggest that future analyzts mimic mode choice structures between activity-based models and microsimulation tools as to ensure more realistic modal distributions.
